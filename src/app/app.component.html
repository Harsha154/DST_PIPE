	<h2>Why should you use PIPE?</h2>
	<p>
		Building plumbing systems can harbor harmful microorganisms, including <i>Legionella</i> which is responsible for <strong>18,000</strong> hospitalizations annually in the United States. In addition, building plumbing can leach harmful substances, such as lead, into drinking water. PIPE helps building owners find the information they need to protect against these health threats.  
	</p>
	<br>
	<h2>How do I use PIPE?</h2>
	<p>
		Answer the support tool's questions about your building. If you know don’t know the answer to a question, you can leave it blank (in that case PIPE will give you less specific information).  
	</p>
	<p><strong>A short video introduction to PIPE, </strong></p>
	<p><iframe  width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JrTdol0QlgM/?controls=1"></iframe></p>
	<br>
	<h2>What does PIPE do? </h2>
	<p>
		PIPE has a summary of information from dozens of guidance documents produced by governmental agencies and professional societies. Based on the information you provide, PIPE will identify the guidance that is relevant to your building. PIPE puts this information into a downloadable document with summaries of key points from different guidance documents links to further information.  
	</p>
	<br>
	<h2>What does PIPE not do?</h2>
	<p>
		PIPE does not make judgments among established sources of information. The many guidance documents are not always consistent. PIPE summarizes what the different guidance documents say but does not resolve inconsistencies among them.  
	</p>
	<br>

	<p><strong>PIPE does not substitute for an engineering evaluation of water safety.</strong></p>

									Your response to questions 10 indicates that you have low flow fixtures present in your building. The following guidance is suggested for maintaining low flow fixtures in the building plumbing system.
								</p>
								<p>According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM 2019) “Lower-flow fixtures, including toilets, dishwashers, washing machines, showerheads, and faucets are required by the EPA WaterSense program to reduce flows by at least 20 percent.” </p>
								<h6 [innerHTML] = "featuresOutput['content-1']"></h6>
								<ul>
									<ul>
										<li>Low flow fixtures can increase <i>Legionella</i> risk due to:</li>
										<ul>
											<li>increase in water age (NASEM 2019)</li>
										</ul>
										<ul>
											<li>a decrease in the residual disinfectant concentration (NASEM 2019)</li>
										</ul>
										<ul>
											<li>Lower flow results in less effective scouring of biofilms and promotes the growth of biofilm-associated <i>Legionella</i> (European Guidelines Working Group, 2017; NASEM 2019)</li>
										</ul>
									</ul>
									<ul>
										<li>Low flow fixtures also take a longer flushing time for the target water temperature to be achieved (NASEM 2019).</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>
								<h6 [innerHTML] = "featuresOutput['content-2']"></h6>
								<ul>
									<ul>
										<li>“Low-flow fixtures should not be allowed in hospitals and long-term care facilities because of their high-risk occupant populations.” (NASEM 2019)</li>
									</ul>
									<ul>
										<li>Low flow fixtures must be flushed a minimum of two times a week to prevent water stagnation leading to <i>Legionella</i> growth (Department of Veterans Affairs 2014).</li>

									Your response to question 8 indicates that the building has a centrally-installed mister, atomizer, air washer, or humidifier. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tool-Kit (CDC, 2017), you need a Water Management Program for any centrally-installed mister, atomizer, air washer, or humidifier. However, water management program template for these devices are not directly available. If these devices are present, one should refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for use for proper cleaning and disinfection instructions of these devices. For more information on developing a water management program for these devices you can refer to the templates available for similar other devices such as cooling systems, medical devices, and other recreational devices available on pages 40-78 of <a target="_blank" href="https://cha.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Water-Management-Program-Template.pdf">the document here</a>.
